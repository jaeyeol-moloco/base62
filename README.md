# Base62 Encoder/Decoder
## a library in several languages to encode byte streams to base62

Roughly based on parts of [A Secure, Lossless, and Compressed Base62
Encoding](http://202.194.20.8/proc/ICCS2008/papers/156.pdf), the encoding scheme does
not use the traditional approach requiring a lot of modulo math and is therefore
considerably more efficient with minimal loss in compression (~0.28%).
